Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a regression model to predict future gold prices using historical financial indicators. The dataset includes variables such as gold price, stock indices, crude oil price, and currency exchange rates.

📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned the financial dataset.

Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.

Selected important features related to gold price movements.

Scaled numerical features to improve model stability.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized gold price trends over time.

Studied correlations between gold price and other economic indicators.

Analyzed feature distributions and financial pattern behavior.

Identified key variables influencing gold market shifts.

3. Modeling

Trained a regression model (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or model used in your notebook).

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Evaluated model performance using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RMSE

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results

The model accurately predicts gold prices based on historical market data. Evaluation metrics demonstrate strong predictive capability, showcasing the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting and investment analytics.
